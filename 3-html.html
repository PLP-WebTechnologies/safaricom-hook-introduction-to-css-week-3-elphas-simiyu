  <p class="intro">Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and it is the only known planet to support life. The Earth's atmosphere, composition, and distance from the Sun create the ideal conditions for a wide variety of life forms to thrive.</p>

  <p class="details">Our planet is made up of land, water, and air, all of which are crucial for sustaining life. Earthâ€™s surface is constantly changing due to natural processes such as erosion, volcanic activity, and plate tectonics. Its diverse ecosystems provide habitats for countless species of plants and animals.</p>

  <p class="conclusion">Earth's environment is delicate, and it's important to preserve it for future generations. By protecting our natural resources and reducing our carbon footprint, we can ensure that Earth remains a habitable place for all life forms.</p>
